# UFOs
### Overview of Project
In Module 12 we worked with Dana to create a webpage and dynamic table using JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and Plotly. Throughout the module we learned how to create a simple table, and create a single filter, to make this data more accessible and easy to read for your average person. In this module Challenge we will create multiple filters, so that the data can be viewed in an even more narrow scope. We will now have filters for Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the object that was sighted. 

### Results
In order to make sure this new table is easy to use the process of how to use it will be described below.

Above is what the website looks like with no filters applied. This includes the few paragraphs that detail the efforts that Dana and her team are working towards.

On the left side of the page, next to the table, all the filtering options are shown. This can be seen clearly in the screenshot above. It is important that when using these filtering buttons that the correct MM/DD/YYYY format is followed for the datetime. Additionally, it is important that no capital letters are used when filtering for the other filters. For those reasons, the placeholders are included to guide the user.

As an example, let us choose some parameters to sort by. Let us create a filter for a sighting (or maybe sightings) that happened on 1/1/2010 in the state of California (ca), which is in the United States (Country: us). When we apply these filters, your webpage should look just like the image above. According to the data, there were 4 sightings that meet these parameters. **Busy Day for the Aliens!**

We could additonally filter by the shape of the UFO that was spotted, if we wanted to get more specific.

### Summary
One drawback of the way these filters can be used, is that you have to make sure that the correct case is used.

In addition the filters that we have already used, it would be nice to add filters for the duration column. However, the way this data was entered was not consistent, so it would take some time and effort to fix this issue. 
Another interesting item to add would be some sort of graph below the table that shows sightings based on location.
